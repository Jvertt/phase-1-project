# Phase 1 Project

* This app generates character cards from the cartoon Rick and Morty. Using a public api and some coding, this app shows every version of ever character on Rick and Morty. There are a few cool functionalities that this app has including the ability to toggle dark mode, and ability for users to search for certain characters, an ability for search results to update as a user types, and the ability for a search to execute with the enter key.
